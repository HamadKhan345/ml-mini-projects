# ML Mini Projects ðŸš€

Welcome to my ML mini projects repository! This collection features small, end-to-end machine learning projects (excluding deployment) to help me practice various ML techniques.

## ðŸ“‚ **Project Structure**
Each project is organized in its own folder. Inside, you'll typically find notebooks, scripts, and data specific to that project.

## ðŸš€ **Getting Started**
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hamadkhan345/ml-mini-projects.git
